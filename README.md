The idea is about traveling app. Where a customer can find a vehicles as per his requirements.(Car,Bike,Van etc.)  
There will be two types of persons using this app
1.	Driver
2.	Customer
Letâ€™s say someone (Driver) own a Vehicle (car) and moving from New York to Los Angles. 
He has account on the app and now make him available for a customer who is also willing to move in the same city.
Both person can connect with each other through the app and decide the price.
Obviously if the owner need 100$ for fuel now he can save of it with having a customer with him and same for the customer.
